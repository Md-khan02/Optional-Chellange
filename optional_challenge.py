# This a program that includes two compilation errors, and a logical error, along with explanations.
# The program to compare and print the largest number.
# Three variables 'numbers' for comparison
number1 = 10
number2 = 20
number3 = '30' # Runtime Error: number3 is a string, not an integer

# if, elif and else statement to finding the largest number
if number1 > number2 and number1 > number3:
    largest number = number1
elif number2 > number1 and number2 > number3 
    larget = number2 # Compilation Error: Missing colon at the end of the elif statement
else:
    largest = numer3 # Compilation Error: Misspelled variable 'number3'

# Now I am going to print the largest number
print("The largest number is " + str(largest)) # Logical Error: Improper handling of data types and potential errors


# Explanation if Errors.
# 1. Runtime Error: 'number3' is a string, which will cause a TypeError when compared with integers.
# 2. Compilation Error: Missing colon (:) at the end of the 'elif' statement, which is a syntax error.
# 3. Compilation Error: Misspelled variable name 'numer3' instead of 'number3'.
# 4. Logical Error: The code does not properly handle the different data types or check for errors in variable names, assuming all inputs are valid and correctly spelled.
